- Azure Blob Storage integration
- Edit/view mode toggling

**Key Features:**

- Image compression (max 1MB, 600px max dimension)
- Progress bar during upload
- Error handling for failed uploads

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Azure Blob Storage Setup

1. Create an Azure Storage Account
2. Create a Blob container
3. Generate a SAS token with the following permissions:

   - **Permissions**: Create, Write
   - **Allowed protocols**: HTTPS only
   - **Expiry time**: Set according to your needs

4. Update the `sasContainerUrl` in the ProfileCard component

### Image Compression Settings

The app automatically compresses images with these settings:

- Maximum file size: 1MB
- Maximum dimensions: 600px (width or height)
- Uses web workers for better performance

## üîß Customization

### Styling

The app uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the appearance by modifying the classes in the components or extending the Tailwind configuration.

### Image Upload Settings

Modify the compression options in `ProfileCard.jsx`:

```javascript
const options = {
  maxSizeMB: 1, // Maximum file size in MB
  maxWidthOrHeight: 600, // Maximum dimension in pixels
  useWebWorker: true, // Use web workers for compression
};
```

## üö® Important Security Notes
